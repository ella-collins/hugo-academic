abstract: With the continuous improvement of scientific and technological strength，various evaluation activities，as well as the number and quality of projects participating in the application of awards，are steadily increasing． To relieve the scoring pressure of the expert judges，the existing project evaluation mechanism often adopts the evaluation method of grouping and then comprehensively sorting．However，when these projects in different groups are sorted in a unified manner，the evaluation differences between different groups bring new challenges． Based on the contradiction between group-based evaluation and unified ranking，in this paper，we design a stable evaluation model to improve the fairness of parallel group-based evaluation，so that the heterogeneous data generated by experts in different groups can be ranked uniformly． The algorithm utilizes a normalization method to eliminate the differences between groups caused by different experts scoring in independent scenarios．Based on the principle of repeated improvement，the project scores and the expert weights are evaluated mutually to obtain a stable weight value of the experts，eliminating the differences caused by the different evaluation standards among the experts．Finally，the processed data can be used for overall ranking between different groups．

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Based on the iterative improvement principle of PageRank and HITS algorithm, a stable evaluation model is established.
